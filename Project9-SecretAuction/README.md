# Secret Auction

This project implements a simple auction management system, using Python Dictionaries.  
The Program works as follows:  
- It asks for the bidder's name and the bidding amount and saves them to a dictionary as a key-value pair.
- After that, it asks the user to enter 'Yes' or 'No':
  - Yes, if there are more bidders
  - No, if you want to see the winner of the Auction
