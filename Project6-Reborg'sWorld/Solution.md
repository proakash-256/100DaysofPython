# Solution

The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze,  
turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.
```python
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()
```
The above might run into an infinite loop, if it's all three sides are clear.  
So first we need to get reborg near a wall. The first while loop helps to get reborg near a wall,  
after which the previous logic will work well.

### Updated Solution:
```python
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
while front_is_clear():
    move()
    
turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()
```
