# Hangman

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence,  
and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses.
This project is an implementation of the hangman game using lists and dictionaries in python.  
The ASCII art used is taken from [here](https://ascii.co.uk/art/hangman).  
The Program works as follows:
- The program chooses a word at random from a list of words, and you have to guess the word, letter by letter.  
- You can make maximum 7 wrong choices, after which you will lose the game.

Run the project and test your skills!!
