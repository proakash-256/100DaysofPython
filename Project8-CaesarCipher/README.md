# Ceaser Cipher

Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext  
is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.  
The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar,  
who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.  
This project is an implementation of Ceaser Cipher in python,  
which uses simple programming techniques to demonstrate the technique.  
The functionalities of the project are:
- It takes a text as input
- It asks whether you want to 'encode' or 'decode' the text.
- It also asks whether you want to continue using the program or not.
